    "Support for 7zip files in Python is limited. Although pandas and other data processing libraries have the ability to directly read gzip and bz2 files, some of the compression algorithms used by 7zip are not well supported by available Python modules. Regardless, the ability to call 7zip from the command line does have some use cases.\n",

    "First, let's try creating a sample 7z file using the command line. The *subprocess* module in the standard library is one way to call the 7zip program directly, as if it were on the command line. This code will write to a temporary directory in C:\\Temp and assumes that you are using Windows. Please modify the temp_dir accordingly if you are using another operating system. Also, please modify the exact location of 7zip on your system using the loc_7z variable. Alternatively, if the 7zip location has been added to the system path, you may just use \"7z\" or \"7z.exe\"."
