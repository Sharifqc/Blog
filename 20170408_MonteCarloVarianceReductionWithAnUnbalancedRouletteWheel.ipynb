    "Much more satisfying. You're now fairly confident of the answer within about a hundredths of a cent. Unfortunately, you don't actually have $50 million to spend (and you certainly don't have the time for 100 million spins). Is there a way to increase the accuracy  (i.e. reduce the variance) of the simulation without spending more money (i.e. requiring more histories)?\n",

In this notebook, we will be examining a method called \"weight correction\". Essentially, instead of choosing values from the original probability distribution, we will choose them from a new probability distribution that we specify. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the idea of \"class balancing\" in classification. We can choose a new probability distribution in such a way as to increase the likelihood that the (originally) less likely choices are selected. This will effectively decrease the variance of the final result. Once we choose a new probability distribution, we must adjust the weight of each choice based on the following formula, so the results will be unbiased:\n",

    "weight_correction = p(x) / p'(x)\n",

    "where p(x) is the original probability distribution and p'(x) is the new probability distribution. This formula is often expressed using the mnemonic \"shoulda over did\". Be careful that every value of x is still possible in the new probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine this in practice. What if we choose a probability distribution such that each of the areas in the roulette wheel are *equally* likely to be chosen? Assume that the roulette operator is nice and allows you to select the results of the roulette so this situation could actually occur in real life. After all, no matter what, the house still wins, right? \n",
