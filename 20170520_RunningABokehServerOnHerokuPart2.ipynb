    "Continuing from the previous blog post, this notebook will explain how to deploy a Bokeh server on Heroku, allowing the world to access the brilliant data visualizations that you've developed using Bokeh. *Note- this tutorial was written in May 2017. If you're reading at a much later date, you may need to update the Python and package versions below (and it's possible that Heroku may not support these versions anymore).*\n",

    "Now, let's prepare the files and folder structure that will be pushed to Heroku. You'll need \"linear_example.py\" from the previous post, which can be downloaded $HERE. Make sure it's named exactly \"linear_example.py\", or the following steps will not work.\n",

    "* **--port=$PORT** specifies which port should be used for the Bokeh server. Usually, if run locally, you might use something like --port=5005. However, Bokeh sets the port dynamically and stores the current port in the PORT environmental variable, which is being accessed by the Bokeh server automatically here.\n",
    "* **--num-procs=0** is used to determine the number of worker processes which may be used for the application. \"0\" means that the number of workers will automatically be detected based on the available cores.\n",
    "* **--host=linregex.herokuapp.com** specifies the domain host that the application will be running on. In this case, the domain is the one that I registered on Heroku, but replace <linregex> with your own Heroku app.\n",
    "* **--address=0.0.0.0** tells Bokeh that the IP address will be assigned dynamically.\n",
    "* **--use-xheaders** tells Bokeh that it should use the xheaders for determining the network protocols. This parameter is required when running Bokeh on Heroku, but not when running a Bokeh server locally.\n",
    "* **linear_example.py** is the name of the Python script that the Bokeh server should run. \n",
