    "Previously, I compared several different methods for analyzing the Abalone dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: multiple regression (http://ericstrong.org/predicting-abalone-rings-part-1/), principal component analysis (http://ericstrong.org/predicting-abalone-rings-part-2/), and neural networks (http://ericstrong.org/predicting-abalone-rings-part-3-multilayer-perceptron/). In Part 3, the neural network was modeled using scikit-learn. However, in this Jupyter notebook, I'll be exploring a new Python neural network library, Keras.\n",

    "I read over the documentation for constructing a neural network in Keras, and I found the examples for a \"Sequential\" model to be straightforward and clear.

If you remember from Part 3 of the prior Abalone dataset investigation, a 20/5 hidden layer configuration was the neural network architecture that achieved the best results. This time, I'll use a \"tanh\" activation function, which achieved fairly similar results to the \"logistic\" activation function. You can review why these parameters are important in my previous post (http://ericstrong.org/predicting-abalone-rings-part-3-multilayer-perceptron/). \n",

When compiling the model, you should choose an optimizer, which refers to how the model will select updated parameters after each training epoch.

Here, I've chosen 'sgd', or stochastic gradient descent. \n",
